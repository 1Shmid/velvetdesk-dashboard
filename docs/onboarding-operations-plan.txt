# ONBOARDING & OPERATIONS PLAN

## 🎯 AUTOMATED ONBOARDING FLOW

### Phase 1: Waitlist → Payment (Customer Journey)

**Step 1: Landing Form**
- Собираем: business_name, contact_name, email
- Собираем: contact_phone (личный), business_phone (куда AI), telecom_operator
- Отправляем verification email

**Step 2: Email Verified**
- Status в waitlist: email_verified
- Ждёт admin approval

**Step 3: Admin Approve (/admin/waitlist)**
- Admin clicks "Approve"
- Создаётся business (status: pending_payment)
- Отправляется payment invite: "Pay €50 to activate"

**Step 4: Payment (LemonSqueezy)**
- Customer pays €50
- Webhook → business (status: active)
- Magic link email: "Set your password"

**Step 5: First Login**
- Welcome tour (tooltips)
- Setup wizard: hours, services, agent settings
- Auto-create VAPI assistant
- Display business phone + forwarding instructions

### Phase 2: AI Agent Setup (Dashboard Wizard)

**Customer fills:**
1. Business hours (working_hours table)
2. Services menu + prices (services table)  
3. Agent personality (name, gender, tone)
4. Custom instructions (special requests, policies)

**System automatically:**
1. POST /api/vapi/assistant → create assistant
2. Save vapi_assistant_id в businesses
3. Generate forwarding guide (PDF) based on telecom_operator
4. Email: "Your AI is ready! Forward calls to [business_phone]"

**No manual work!** ✅

## 👔 OPERATOR HANDOFF STRATEGY

### When to Transfer to Human

**Triggers:**
1. Customer explicitly asks: "хочу менеджера", "real person"
2. AI confidence < 70% (uncertain answer)
3. Complaint or refund request
4. Complex booking modification

### Transfer Methods

**Method A: Direct Call Transfer (VAPI feature)**
- AI says: "Connecting you to our manager..."
- VAPI transfers to business.contact_phone
- Works 0-10 clients (low volume)

**Method B: Ticket + Callback**
- AI: "Manager will call you back in 10 minutes"
- Create support_tickets record (customer_name, phone, issue)
- Email business owner: "Urgent callback needed"
- Works 10-50 clients

**Method C: Support Dashboard (50+ clients)**
- Dedicated support operator pool
- /dashboard/support-tickets
- SLA: 10 min response time

### Norms & Procedures

**Response Times:**
- Urgent (complaint): 10 min callback
- Standard (question): 30 min
- Low priority: 2 hours

**Business Hours Only:**
- Outside hours: "We're closed, call back Mon-Fri 9-18"
- Emergency line: business owner decides (optional)

**Quality Checks:**
- Random call review (10% sample)
- Customer satisfaction survey after handoff
- AI learns from human operator responses

## 💰 COST BREAKDOWN (per customer)

**Fixed Costs (VelvetDesk):**
- Supabase: $0.05/customer/month
- Vercel: $0.02/customer/month

**Variable Costs (per customer):**
- VAPI: ~€30-50/month (based on call volume)
- Twilio phone: €1/month (optional, if we provide number)

**Revenue:**
- Setup: €50 (one-time)
- Recurring: €350/month

**Margin:** ~85% after VAPI costs

**Break-even:** 1 customer = profitable

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### 1. Payment Processor Freeze
**Risk:** Payoneer/Wise замораживает при $5k+
**Solution:**
- Prepare SoF pack (Source of Funds): invoices, contracts, explainer PDF
- Gradual scaling (10 → 50 → 100 customers)
- Multiple accounts (Wise + Paysera backup)

### 2. VAPI Downtime
**Risk:** VAPI API unavailable
**Solution:**
- Health check every 5 min
- Fallback: Twilio direct (basic IVR menu)
- Email alerts to admin

### 3. Customer Complaints
**Risk:** AI не справляется, клиент требует refund
**Solution:**
- 7-day money-back guarantee (€50 setup fee)
- Recurring €350 - cancel anytime (no refund for current month)
- Human handoff within 10 min

### 4. Scaling Issues
**Risk:** Too many customers, manual work grows
**Solution:**
- Automate onboarding 100%
- Self-serve dashboard (no support calls)
- Hire VA (Virtual Assistant) at 100+ customers

---

## 📈 SCALING STRATEGY

### 0-10 Customers (Manual OK)
- Admin approves waitlist manually
- Direct call transfer to owner phone
- Personal email support

### 10-50 Customers (Semi-automated)
- Auto-approve waitlist (if email verified)
- Ticket system (no direct transfer)
- FAQ + chatbot support

### 50-100 Customers (Fully automated)
- Zero manual intervention
- Support dashboard with SLA tracking
- Video tutorials + knowledge base

### 100+ Customers (Team)
- Hire support operator (€1,500/mo)
- Dedicated account manager for high-value clients (€500+/mo plans)
- Multi-language support (EN/ES/FR)
